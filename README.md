# metallo.js

This is just an experiment I'm running to understand if [metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) is a valid alternative to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Run

`make serve` will serve the static website locally on port 8000.

Optionally run `make watch`, in another terminal, to watch the `src` folder and rebuild every time a file changes.
